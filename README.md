Project title --Titanic Survival Prediction
This project uses the Titanic data set to explore data cleaning ,feature engineering, and apply supervised machine learing models for survival prediction
PROJECT OVERVIEW
->DATASET: Titanic dataset ("train.csv")
->Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived or not.
#Techniques Used#
->Data cleaning and feature engineering
->supervised learning models:
->Linear Regression
->Decision Tree Classifier
-**Evaluation**:Accuracy,MSE,R^2 score

--->'train.csv'-->Titanic dataset
Clustering: Use K-means to find clusters in the dat
Dimensionality Reduction: By applying PCA to reduse the dimensionally of the data for visualization
